due to light scattering and absorption while traveling through water, underwater images become hazy and loose critical information resulting in poor contrast and color performance. hence, it is difficult to see the difference between foreground colors and items, and to differentiate the background in these images. to solve these issues, this study proposes a novel thniquqec for single underwater image enhancement which is based on the recovery of the lost red-channel via a weighted multi-scale fusion.
